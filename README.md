UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransitionWithCABasicAnimation
========================================================

This project is for demo station purposes. When using gesture driven UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition with CABasic (or any other CAAnimation), upon finishInteractiveTransition animation jumps to final position, rather then animating smoothly as is the case when using UIView block animation. I am trying to figure out how to animate smoothly upon finishInteractiveTransition to end from when using CAAnimation.
